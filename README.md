### About us

Our team has been working in the e-commerce industry for over 10 years. As we were helping brands to grow their online businesses, we realized that they were all struggling with complex or archaic systems to manage product information.

We founded Akeneo in 2013 with the idea that products are the most important assets in a company and that many merchants lack a tool to help them manage and leverage this crucial asset. Merchants needed a tool that was designed for marketers and flexible enough to be integrated with any third-party application.

Akeneo PIM integrates with Adobe Commerce/Magento platform via a powerful Connector historically built by its Gold Solution Partner, Agence Dn'D, a true expert in implementing the joint solution.

Akeneo and Adobe Commerce/Magento solutions are a logical fit as they are both Open Source, share the same technology stack, and count many joint customers benefiting from the combined value proposition.

Akeneo now partners with Agence Dn'D on Akeneo Connector for Adobe Commerce/Magento, to provide the best customer experience to Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce merchants looking for a compelling product experience that will improve their revenue.
